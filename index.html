            <p>
                We are a group of friends who bonded over our passion for
                development and personal growth. Our first project together was
                a playlist generator for a Hackathon in 2022, and we have been
                working on fulfilling our mission of growth, community, and
                learning ever since. We do so through developing real software
                in an environment as close to a real software team as possible.
                We incorporate our value of teamwork into every part of the
                development process, from planning and research to development
                and testing. We also practice leadership and accountability
                through dynamic member roles on each project.
            </p>
            <h2 style="margin-top: 10px">Mission</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Growth</strong>: we believe in growing our teamwork,
                leadership, and development skills through practical application
                of real software practices.
                <br />
                <strong>Community</strong>: we strive to involve the community
                with our projects and establish a greater bond between UNL
                students and the greater community.
                <br />
                <strong>Learning</strong>: we firmly believe the best way to
                learn is to do, which is why we explore new technologies and
                methodologies by making real software projects.
